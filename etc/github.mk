# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we
as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in
our project and our community a harassment-free experience for
everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex
characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance,
race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive
environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome 
  sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal 
  or political attacks 
* Public or private harassment 
* Publishing others' private information, such as a 
  physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered 
  inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards
of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and
fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable
behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove,
edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and
other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct,
or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other
behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or
harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in
public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its
community. Examples of representing a project or community include
using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official
social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at
an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior
may be reported by contacting the project team at $(Email).
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result
in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the
circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality
with regard to the reporter of an incident.  Further details of
specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct
in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as
determined by other members of the project's leadership.
